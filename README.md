# Drag-n-Drop slides/demos/etc

Hi there, Beer City Code folks. 

* If you're looking for the drag-and-drop code itself, look in `client/drag-drop` and `client/demos/dropping`.
* If you're looking for slide content, look in `client/slides.tsx`
* If you'd like to run this code yourself, follow the README files in the API and the client directories, then run `./serve.sh`
